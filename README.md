# Clustering water samples based on main ions and cations

This project provides the basis in order to perform an efficient and reproducable clustering on water samples. It has been created in the framework of the [MedSal project](https://medsal.eu/).

Input data are either excel/csv files that get imported or through direct access to the [MedSal Database](https://www.uhydro.de/medsaldba). 

It currently includes following steps:

* Step 1: Data

    * Import data
    * Subset data

* Step 2: Data quality assessment

    * Calculate the charge balance error
    
* Step 3: Cluster analysis

    * Pre-processing
    * Define the number of clusters
    * Plot dendrogram of clusters
    
* Step 4: Data visualization

    * Piper plot
    * Shoeller plot
    * Boxplots
    * Composite diagrams
