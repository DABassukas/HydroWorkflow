# Clustering water samples based on main ions and cations

This project provides the basis in order to perform an efficient and reproducable clustering on water samples. It has been created in the framework of the [MedSal project](https://medsal.eu/).

Input data are either excel/csv files that get imported or through direct access to the [MedSal Database](https://www.uhydro.de/medsaldba).
